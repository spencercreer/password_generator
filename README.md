# password_generator
This application generates a random password based on criteria that the user selects.

When the user clicks the generate password button, then the user is prompted to enter a password length. The user then confirms the character types that the user would like included in the password. Once the user answers the prompts successfully, then a random password is generated based on the criteria that the user selected. The password is printed to the screen.
